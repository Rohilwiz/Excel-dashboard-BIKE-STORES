# Excel-dashboard-BIKE-STORES
An Interactive Excel sales Dashboard Created.
I have created an excel dashboard using a bike stores data from  link : https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/ 
The data was cleaned enough so created dashboard using pivot tables and found out some insights.
Insights like: 
A. Max. revenue was generated in 2017 among 3 given years.
B. Among 3 stores given **Baldwin Bikes** alone had 68% revenue share. 
C. Top 10 customers data, Category wise revenue and many more.
